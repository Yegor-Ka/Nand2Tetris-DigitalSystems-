# Digital Systems (Nand2Tetris) – Projects 1–6

This repository contains my implementations of **Projects 1–6** from the  
**Digital Systems (Nand2Tetris)** course, completed during the **First Semester of 2024**  
as part of the **B.Sc. in Computer Science** program at **Reichman University**.

---

## Overview

The Nand2Tetris course guides students through the process of building a computer system completely from first principles.  
Starting from a single NAND gate, the projects progress through hardware design, low-level programming, and system architecture.  
This repository includes all the hardware and software components developed up to Project 6.

## Projects Included

| Project | Topic | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 01 | Boolean Logic | Implementation of fundamental logic gates (`Not`, `And`, `Or`, `Xor`, `Mux`, `DMux`, etc.). |
| 02 | Boolean Arithmetic | Construction of adders, ALU components, and arithmetic circuits. |
| 03 | Sequential Logic | Design of sequential chips including registers, counters, and memory units. |
| 04 | Machine Language | Writing and testing assembly programs for the Hack computer platform. |
| 05 | Computer Architecture | Building the Hack CPU, memory, and integrating them into a complete computer. |
| 06 | Assembler | Implementation of a two-pass assembler that translates Hack assembly code into binary machine code. |

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding the relationship between hardware and software.  
- Designing digital circuits using a hardware description language (HDL).  
- Building an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and CPU architecture.  
- Writing and assembling low-level machine code programs.  
- Implementing an assembler in a high-level programming language (Java or Python).

## Tools and Technologies

- **Nand2Tetris Software Suite** (Hardware Simulator, CPU Emulator, Assembler)  
- **HDL (Hardware Description Language)**  
- **Hack Assembly Language**  
- **Java / Python** (for the Assembler implementation)
